# Backend API URL for production (Node.js/Express)
# This is your main backend server for user authentication, data storage, etc.
VITE_API_URL=https://farmiq-app.onrender.com/api

# ML Backend API URL for production (FastAPI/Python)  
# This is your ML prediction server for crop disease detection and soil analysis
VITE_ML_APP=https://farmiq-ml-backend.onrender.com

# ============================================
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# When running locally, uncomment and use these instead:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
# VITE_ML_APP=http://localhost:8000
#
# Or leave them blank to use the default fallback URLs in the code

# ============================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ============================================
# 1. The ML Backend uses these endpoints:
#    - /predict/plant - for crop disease detection
#    - /predict/soil - for soil analysis
#    - /health - health check endpoint
#
# 2. Never commit the actual .env file to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 3. Copy this file to .env and update with your actual values
# 4. For production (Vercel/Render), set these in the platform's environment variables section
